## [Problem Statement](#GrocerEase)

Our approach is based on developing an intelligent, fully autonomous trolley based on `Raspberry-pi` that is capable of following the consumer in shopping complexes or grocery stores. This incorporates state-of-the-art techniques like object-detection, deep learning, etc.

## [Conceptualisation](#GrocerEase)

We, at C.A.T technologies, with the aim to make autonomous machines even more independent, develop cutting-edge technology based on state-of-the-art Machine Learning and Robotics algorithms. It gives us great satisfaction by providing the consumers with best hassle-free shopping experience.
