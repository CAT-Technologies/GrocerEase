\item Pull requests
\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Please create a separate branch for each issue that you\textquotesingle{}re working on. Do not make changes to the default branch (e.\+g. master, develop) of your fork.
\item Tag the actual issue number by replacing \#\mbox{[}issue\+\_\+number\mbox{]} e.\+g. \#42. This closes the issue when your PR is merged.
\item Tag the actual issue author by replacing @\mbox{[}author\mbox{]} e.\+g. @issue\+\_\+author. This brings the reporter of the issue into the conversation.
\item More information on how add description to your Pull request \href{https://opensource.creativecommons.org/contributing-code/pr-guidelines/populated_pr.png}{\texttt{ here}}

\hypertarget{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md18}{}\doxysection{Bug reports}\label{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md18}
A bug is a {\itshape demonstrable problem} that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful -\/ thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries{Use the Git\+Hub issue search}} --- check if the issue has already been reported.
\item {\bfseries{Check if the issue has been fixed}} --- try to reproduce it using the latest {\ttfamily master} or development branch in the repository.
\item {\bfseries{Isolate the problem}} --- create a \href{http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/}{\texttt{ reduced test case}} and a live example.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

A good bug report shouldn\textquotesingle{}t leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example\+:

\begin{quote}
Short and descriptive example bug report title

A summary of the issue and the browser/\+OS environment in which it occurs. If suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item This is the first step
\item This is the second step
\item Further steps, etc.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

{\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}url\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} -\/ a link to the reduced test case

Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their merits). \end{quote}
